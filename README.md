# Dynamic Selenium Web Automation with Java

This Java Selenium script automates the process of counting the number of links on a webpage, clicking on each link, and performing assertions. The script is designed to adapt to changes in the webpage's HTML structure.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following set up:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Selenium WebDriver
- Chrome WebDriver (or WebDriver for your preferred browser)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Replace the WebDriver path with the path to your WebDriver executable.

3. Execute the script by running the `main` method.

4. The script will open a webpage, dynamically count the links, click on each link, and perform assertions, even if the number or structure of links changes.
